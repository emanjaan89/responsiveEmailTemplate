                   Converting an idea into a reality (regardless of the required investment of time and money) is never an easy task. In fact, it is extremely difficult. Whether you are an entrepreneur or corporate executive, “giving ideas life” is much like giving birth to a child. You must own the responsibility regardless of the circumstances. No one will ever understand your idea or the dynamics associated with it like you do. In this regard, you are on your own and the journey will require you to learn about yourself – more than anything else will in your career.

As the old saying goes, “If it were easy – everyone would do it.”

                        Accountability requires believing in yourself enough to be 100% dedicated to getting the work done.
                        Most people fail to take an idea to fruition because the un  expected challenges become more than they think they can handle and thus they no longer want to be accountable.
                        They lose the belief in themselves to see things through all the way to the end.
